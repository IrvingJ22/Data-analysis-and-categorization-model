# Data-analysis-and-categorization-model
Data set describing the customers of a bank, where there are 2 categories, label = 1 which refers to customers who have a 
credit card and label = 0 which refers to customers who do not have a credit card.

Main objetive with dataset
To make an analysis of the main characteristics of the dataset, as well as to make a cleaning of the dataset and to use 
different types of imputation methods to fill in the null data. 

Important features:
- label --> Have or not a credit card

How was it achieved?
- The cleaning was achieved through different imputation methods such as: mean imputation, median, mode and multiple
  imputaion
- And the clasification algotrim that I used was the K-Nearest Neighbors, with this algoritm I got a pressicion percent
  of 87%, the highest was with k = 3.
